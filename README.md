# Data-Warehousing-Business-Intelligence-Report-Monash-Equipment-Centre-
This assignment focuses on cleaning data from a given oracle database, making a star schema and finally diving into the insights using PowerBI

## Case Study

*Note: This project is a fictional case study developed as part of an academic assignment on Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence using Power BI.*

Monash Equipment Centre (MonEquip) is an Australian-based company that provides a wide range of equipment for civil infrastructure and commercial construction projects.
The company has two main business functions: 
1. Selling equipment along with excellent after-sales service
2. Providing equipment for hire while ensuring a seamless hiring experience

MonEquip has different branches throughout the state of Victoria, in which the management team frequently generates reports to keep track of the business (e.g. calculating the revenues from hiring and selling equipment). The reports are then used for forecasting various trends and making predictions about the business. 

MonEquip currently has an existing operational database which maintains and stores all of the information of their business transactions (e.g. product hiring, product sales, equipment, etc.) required for the management's daily operation. The operational database records the transaction from April 2018 to December 2020. However, since the staff at MonEquip has limited database knowledge and the operational database is quite large, the management team has decided to hire you as a Data Warehouse Engineer to design, develop, and quickly generate Business Intelligence reports from a new Data Warehouse.

## Implementation Process

### Transformation Stage:
- Preprocessing the data
- Designing a suitable star schema

### Analysis Stage:
- Moving preprocessed star schema data into PowerBI
- Making appropriate diagrams for analysis
- Data interpretation and insights

### Reporting Stage:
- A poster summarising the overall process and key business insights.
